# Water System Simulator

## Python library with an example.

To use, define a system then run Simulate(system)


Pumps can be damaged if trying to overfill a tank or not pumping enough water

TODO:
- more health features and warnings
- load sink/well data from external file and simulate over time
- Improve visuals
- add images that appear when hovering over a subsystem to better explain said system (relays)
